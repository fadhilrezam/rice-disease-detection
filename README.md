Deep Learning Project (Image Classification) - Disease and Nutrient Deficiency Symptoms in Rice Plant

Hi. My name is Fadhil Reza Maulana. In this project, me and my teammate I (M.Naufal Aulia Adam) created an app called PeSen (Petani Senang). This app is used to predict what kind of disease and nutrient deficiency happens to a rice plant using Image Classification.

In this project, I am responsible for creating a model to predict the disease and Naufal Aulia Adam is responsible for creating a model to predict the nutrient deficiency.

In this repository, I include some files that contain information about this project:
1. rice_disease_detection.ipynb: notebook about modeling the image classification model for rice disease
2. rice_nutrient_deficiency_detection.ipynb: notebook about modeling the image classification model for rice nutrient deficiency
3. output: a folder that contains images of rice plants for the rice disease model
4. PeSen (Petani Senang).pptx: Powerpoint about our project and application

If you have any questions, don't hesitate just ask me. Thank you!
